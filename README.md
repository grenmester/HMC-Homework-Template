# HMC Homework Template
This script creates a TeX template in the current directory that uses the Harvey Mudd College class file and format. If the proper class file `hmcpset.cls` is not found, it will ask whether you would like one to be made. It will also make sure that no existing files will be overwritten.

## Usage
This script is written for Python 2.7. To use it, simply type the following into your command prompt.
```{bash}
python createTemplate.py
```
